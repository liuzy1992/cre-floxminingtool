123123	cre1	Adipoq-cre	adipoq-cre	14934	SIRT6	sirt6	In contrast, the Sirt6 knockout mice generated by the Adipoq-Cre line (Sirt6f/f:Adipoq-Cre) only had modest insulin resistance.
123123	cre3	Fabp4-cre	fabp4-cre	14934	SIRT6	sirt6	In conclusion, our data suggest that the function of SIRT6 in the Fabp4-Cre-expressing cells in addition to mature adipocytes plays a critical role in body weight maintenance and metabolic homeostasis
